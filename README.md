This project aims to develop a non-invasive device for monitoring ketosis through breath analysis using an Arduino Uno, an MQ-135 gas sensor, and a DHT-22 temperature and humidity sensor. The device measures the concentration of acetone in the breath, which serves as a key indicator of fat metabolism and ketosis, particularly useful for individuals following ketogenic diets or managing diabetes. The Arduino-based prototype involves connecting the gas sensor and temperature sensor to the Arduino board, reading and calibrating the sensor values, and displaying the results on an SH1106 1.3-inch monochrome I2C screen. The system takes into account the temperature and humidity to ensure accurate acetone level measurements.

The significance of this device lies in its potential to provide a convenient, real-time method for monitoring metabolic states without the need for invasive blood tests. By analyzing breath acetone levels, users can track their fat metabolism, aiding in weight management and optimizing diet plans. The project underscores the growing interest in breath analysis as a tool for medical diagnostics and personal health monitoring, with future development aimed at creating a wearable, more efficient product capable of accurately detecting acetone levels and potentially diagnosing diabetes. This innovative approach leverages current technology to address a practical need, offering a promising solution for continuous health monitoring.
